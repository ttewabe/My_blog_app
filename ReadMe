//pagination 
`<a href="#" data-page="${i}">${i}</a>
is an HTML anchor (<a>) element with two attributes: href and data-page. Here's what each part does:

<a>: This is the HTML anchor element, often referred to as a link. It's used to create hyperlinks that can take users to other web pages or locations within the same page.

href="#": The href attribute specifies the URL that the link points to. In this case, it's set to "#", which is commonly used as a placeholder URL. When the user clicks this link, it typically doesn't navigate to a new page but may trigger JavaScript events or scroll to a specific section of the current page due to the "#" character.

data-page="${i}": The data-page attribute is a custom data attribute in HTML. It allows you to store custom data associated with an HTML element. In this case, it's set to the value ${i}, which means it will be replaced with the value of the i variable when the HTML is generated. The purpose of this attribute is often to store additional data that JavaScript can access later.

${i}: This is a placeholder for a JavaScript variable called i. When the HTML is generated dynamically (e.g., within a loop), ${i} will be replaced with the current value of i. This is a common technique used to generate unique values or content for each iteration of a loop.

// currentPage
The code snippet currentPage = parseInt(e.target.getAttribute('data-page') || '1'); is used to extract the value of the data-page attribute from an HTML element and assign it to the currentPage variable after converting it to an integer. Let's break down this line of code step by step:

e: This typically represents an event object, often passed as a parameter to an event handler function. In this context, it's an event object representing the click event on an HTML element.

e.target: The target property of the event object refers to the HTML element that triggered the event. In this case, it's the HTML element that was clicked, which should be one of the pagination links or buttons.

getAttribute('data-page'): This part of the code retrieves the value of the data-page attribute from the clicked HTML element. The getAttribute method is used to access custom data attributes like data-page in HTML elements. The data-page attribute typically stores the page number associated with that particular link or button.

parseInt(...): The parseInt function is used to parse a string and convert it to an integer. In this context, it's used to convert the value of the data-page attribute, which is initially a string, to an integer. This integer represents the page number.

|| '1': The || operator is the logical OR operator. If the getAttribute('data-page') part doesn't return a valid integer (for example, if the data-page attribute is missing or empty), the || '1' part provides a default value of '1'. So, if the data-page attribute is missing or empty, it assumes that the current page is page 1.

In summary, this line of code extracts the page number from the data-page attribute of the clicked HTML element. If the attribute is missing or empty, it defaults to page 1. The extracted page number is then assigned to the currentPage variable, typically for the purpose of updating the current page when a pagination link or button is clicked.
